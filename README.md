# DnDice



After a single game of Dungeons and Dragons, I was inspired to create a light-weight app to give users a utility to roll their dices and a nice light U/X while doing it.

More than that, I've very much enjoyed writing this as a practice on animations and unit testing on my free time. So if you're curious about my coding style/discipline, please feel free to clone/download this repo, or even better, submit a PR on things you think I should improve. Critiques are very much welcome!

This app is already published! [Check it out it's free ^^](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dndices/id1225043908?ls=1&mt=8)
